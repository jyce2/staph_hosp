Abstract

**Objective** – We aim to examine an association between methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and hospitalization among residents in the metro-Atlanta region of the United States, while adjusting for patient factors, such as septicemia, kidney dialysis, diabetes, smoking status, wounds, and age at the time of infection in community and healthcare settings.<br>
**Methods** –This retrospective, surveillance study was conducted by the Georgia Emerging Infections Program in Fulton County, Georgia. A cohort of patients with S. aureus infection was surveyed among 19 acute care hospitals, 1 pediatric hospital, and 2 referral laboratories in 2017. The primary outcome was hospitalization following S. aureus infection. We accounted for the sampling weights of non-invasive infections (1:4) and invasive infections (1:1), given by the survey design. We analyzed associations between MRSA infection and hospitalization in healthcare-associated (HA) and community-onset (CO) infections, after adjusting for septicemia, kidney dialysis, diabetes, smoking, open wounds, and patient age at the time of infection, using weighted logistic regression.<br>
**Results** – Hospitalizations were 73% more likely among patients with MRSA (51.2%) than those with the methicillin-susceptible strain (29.5%) (aOR = 1.74, 95% CI [1.61, 1.87]). In addition, the risk of hospitalization was 49% more likely among patients with MRSA than methicillin-susceptible strain (MSSA), after adjusting for CO and HA infections (aOR = 1.49, [1.39, 1.59]). In both CO and HA infections, patients with MRSA were 115% more likely than MSSA to experience hospitalization, after adjusting for septicemia, kidney dialysis, diabetes, smoking, open wounds, and patient age at the time of infection (aOR = 2.15, 95% CI = [1.57, 2.96]).<br>
**Conclusion** – In 2017, patients with MRSA infections were at an increased risk of hospitalization compared to those with MSSA in both community and healthcare-associated settings in metro-Atlanta, after adjusting for septicemia, kidney dialysis, diabetes, smoking, open wounds, and patient age at the time of infection. The estimated probability of hospitalization was 3 times higher in healthcare compared to community settings in patients with S. aureus infection. Septicemia was a leading factor of hospitalization in all cases of infection regardless of strain.<br>
