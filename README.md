Abstract

**Objective** – To examine an association between methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) and hospitalization, after adjusting for related health conditions in community and healthcare settings.<br>
**Methods** –The Georgia Emerging Infections Program conducted a county-wide surveillance study on patients with *S. aureus* infection in 2017. Data from this cohort were collected by all 19 acute care hospitals, 1 pediatric hospital, and 2 referral laboratories in Fulton County, Georgia. Hospitalization, or inpatient status, is the primary outcome, following infection. We account for the sampling weights of non-invasive infection (1:4) and invasive infections (1:1), given by the survey-weighted sampling design. Association tests, including Wilcoxon rank sum, Pearson chi-square and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel, were used to examine whether patient demographic and clinical factors were associated with hospitalization. Furthermore, weighted logistic regression models were tested to adjust for potential confounders influencing the association of MRSA infection and hospitalization in both healthcare-associated (HA) and community-onset (CO) infections.<br>
**Results** – Hospitalizations were 73% more likely among patients with MRSA (51.2%) than those with MSSA (29.5%) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of (1.61, 1.87). In addition, the risk of hospitalization was 49% more likely among patients with MRSA than MSSA, after adjusting for CO and HA infections (95% CI of [1.39, 1.59]). In both CO and HA infections, the estimated odds of hospitalization among MRSA was 2.15 times the odds of hospitalization among MSSA, after adjusting for septicemia, kidney dialysis, diabetes, smoking, open wounds, and patient age at the time of infection (95% CI = [1.57, 2.96]).<br>
**Conclusion** – Patients with MRSA infections were at an increased risk for hospitalization compared to those with MSSA in both community and healthcare-associated settings, after adjusting for septicemia, kidney dialysis, diabetes, smoking, open wounds, and patient age at the time of infection.
