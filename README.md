**Abstract**

**Objective** – The aim of this paper is to predict a correlated binary outcome, hospitalization, among patients diagnosed with *Staphylococcus aureus* infection at various hospitals in the metro-Atlanta region of the United States in 2017 using a random-effect logistic regression model. Patient variables include age, septicemia, ongoing dialysis treatment, diabetes status, smoking status, methicillin-resistant *S. aureus* (MRSA)-specific infection, and wound at the time of infection. Patients were stratified by community-onset and healthcare-associated infection.<br><br>
**Methods** – The Georgia Emerging Infections Program conducted a surveillance study in Fulton County, Georgia. A cohort of patients with *S. aureus* infection was surveyed from 19 acute care hospitals, 1 pediatric hospital, and 2 referral laboratories in 2017. The primary outcome was hospitalization following *S. aureus* infection. We applied survey weights to non-invasive infections (1:4) and invasive infections (1:1) to account for unequal sampling probabilities. Risk factor variables were selected according to medical literature. A baseline weighted logistic regression model was applied to predict the likelihood of hospitalization following infection based on age, bloodstream infection, dialysis, diabetes, smoking, MRSA, and wounds at the time of infection. In addition, we specified other models: 1) a weighted logistic regression model stratified by community-onset and healthcare-associated infection 2) a weighted logistic regression model with random intercepts clustered at the hospital level 3) a weighted logistic regression model with random-intercepts clustered at the hospital level and stratified by community-onset and healthcare-associated infection. All tests were performed at a two-sided significance level of 0.05. We evaluated the predictive performance and fit of these models based on the AUC-ROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). In addition, we examined the random-effect variance estimate to assess the intra-class correlation within hospitals. Weighted descriptive tables were produced using R software (Version 4.4.1). Exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).<br><br>
**Results** – In the baseline weighted logistic regression model, all risk factors, including age, septicemia, dialysis, diabetes, smoking, MRSA, and wound, were positively associated with hospitalization. After stratification, the community-onset model showed that all risk factors, except age and dialysis, were positively associated with hospitalization, whereas the healthcare-associated model showed that all risk factors, except age and wound were positively associated with hospitalization. The odds of hospitalization due to septicemia were 99 times higher than that without septicemia in community-onset infections, while the odds of hospitalization from septicemia were 10 times higher than that without septicemia in healthcare-associated infections, adjusting for other risk factors. The weighted logistic regression model with random intercepts clustered at the hospital level showed that only age, bloodstream infection, dialysis, diabetes, and wound were significant risk factors of hospitalization, whereas smoking status and MRSA were not. The weighted logistic stratified model for community-onset infections, accounting for hospital-level clustering, showed that age, diabetes, dialysis, and septicemia, were positively associated with hospitalization, whereas for healthcare-associated infections, only septicemia was positively associated with hospitalization, controlling for the other risk factors. The stratified, weighted random-effect logistic model had the highest AUC-ROC score (0.956) for predicting hospitalization of a patient in Fulton County, Georgia compared to the other models. The model fit metric using BIC for the baseline weighted logistic model and the weighted, random-intercept logistic model were, respectively, 4185.2 and 2758.1. Additionally, the weighted, random-intercept logistic community-onset model showed that the random-intercept variance differed significantly between hospitals (p = 0.035), in contrast to the hospital-associated model (p=0.089). Hospital IDs, GA040, GA065, GAMDO, had significantly lower odds of hospitalization compared to other hospitals, while GA011, GA026, GA004, GA027, GA009, GA032, and GA015 had significantly higher odds of hospitalization compared to other hospitals.<br><br>
**Conclusion** – Septicemia was a leading factor of hospitalization in all cases of *S.aureus* infection, after controlling for age, dialysis treatment, diabetes status, smoking status, MRSA, and wound at the time of infection. The classification model with the highest discriminatory power was a weighted random-effect logistic model, accounting for stratification. Accounting for the random variance between hospitals and stratifying by community-onset and healthcare-associated infection were effective at controlling the Type I error rate. As a result, the logistic random-effects model produced less biased results at predicting risk factors of hospitalization than the baseline weighted logistic model. This paper predicts risk factors of hospitalization among patients with *S. aureus* infection in the metro-Atlanta region in 2017 to understand populations at risk and to identify factors that can mitigate hospital burden in the future.<br>
