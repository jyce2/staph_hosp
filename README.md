Abstract

**Objective** – To examine associations between methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) infections and hospitalizations, adjusting for related comorbidities and health conditions among infection acquired in community and healthcare settings.<br>
**Methods** –The Georgia Emerging Infections Program conducted surveillance on patients with S. aureus infection in 2017. Data from this cohort were collected by all 19 acute care hospitals, 1 pediatric hospital, and 2 referral laboratories in Fulton County, Georgia. In this study, hospitalization after infection was the primary outcome. We accounted for the 1:4 weights in non-invasive infection and the 1:1 weights in invasive infections, given by the survey-weighted sampling design. Association tests, including Wilcoxon rank sum, Pearson chi-square and Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel, were used to examine whether patient demographic and clinical factors were associated with hospitalization. Furthermore, weighted logistic regression models were tested to adjust for potential confounders influencing the association of MRSA infection and hospitalization in either healthcare-associated (HA) or community-onset (CO) infections.<br>
**Results** – Hospitalizations were 73% more likely among patients with MRSA infection (51.2%) than those with methicillin-susceptible *Staphylococcus aureus* (MSSA) (29.5%) infection (95% CI = [1.61, 1.87]). In addition, the risk of hospitalization was 1.49 times higher among MRSA than MSSA, after adjusting for CO and HA infections (95% CI of [1.39, 1.59]). In CO infections, the estimated odds of hospitalization of MRSA were 116 percent higher than the odds of hospitalization of MSSA, after adjusting for bloodstream infections, diabetes, smoking status, and wounds at the time of infection (95% CI = [1.36-3.42]). In HA infections, the estimated odds of hospitalization of MRSA were 109 percent higher than the odds of hospitalization of MSSA, after adjusting for bloodstream infections, diabetes, kidney dialysis, and smoking status (95% CI = [1.26-3.48]).<br>
**Conclusion** – MRSA was positively associated with hospitalization in both HA and CO infections, after adjusting for bloodstream infections, diabetes, kidney dialysis, current smoking status, and wounds at the time of infection.
