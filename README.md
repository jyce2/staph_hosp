Abstract

**Objective** – To examine an association between methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) and hospitalization among residents in the metro-Atlanta region of the United States, after adjusting for related health conditions in community and healthcare settings.<br>
**Methods** –This retrospective observational study was conducted using sample cohort data from the Georgia Emerging Infections Program in Fulton County, Georgia. Only patients with *S. aureus* infection were surveyed among 19 acute care hospitals, 1 pediatric hospital, and 2 referral laboratories in 2017. The primary outcome was hospitalization following *S. aureus* infection. We account for the sampling weights of non-invasive infection (1:4) and invasive infections (1:1), given by the survey-weighted sampling design. We analyzed associations between MRSA infection with hospitalization in healthcare-associated (HA) and community-onset (CO) infections using weighted logistic regression. <br>
**Results** – Hospitalizations were 73% more likely among patients with MRSA (51.2%) than those with MSSA (29.5%) (aOR = 1.74, 95% CI [1.61, 1.87]). In addition, the risk of hospitalization was 49% more likely among patients with MRSA than MSSA, after adjusting for CO and HA infections (aOR = 1.49, [1.39, 1.59]). In both CO and HA infections, patients with MRSA were 115% more likely than MSSA to experience hospitalization, after adjusting for septicemia, kidney dialysis, diabetes, smoking, open wounds, and patient age at the time of infection (aOR = 2.15, 95% CI = [1.57, 2.96]).<br>
**Conclusion** – Patients with MRSA infections were at an increased risk of hospitalization compared to those with MSSA in both community and healthcare-associated settings, after adjusting for septicemia, kidney dialysis, diabetes, smoking, open wounds, and patient age at the time of infection. Septicimia was a significant factor of hospitalization in all instances of infection, whether or not the acquired strain was methicillin-resistant.
